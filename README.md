### Overview
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing bank churn data to gain insights into the factors influencing customer turnover. The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and reliability in the analysis. By leveraging various visualization techniques, the project highlights key metrics and trends related to customer churn, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

During the data transformation phase, several crucial steps were undertaken to prepare the data for analysis:

1.Column Renaming: Renamed columns for clarity.

2.Column Quality Check: Ensured the quality and consistency of data.

3.Created Bins:

  i.Age Group Bins: Grouped customers into age ranges.

  ii.Credit Score Bins: Grouped customers based on their credit scores.

  iii.Two duplicate tables were created:

4.One table with unique age group bins.

5.Another table with unique credit score bins.

### Data Modeling

After loading the data into Power BI, the data modeling was verified to ensure correct relationships between the tables.

### Measures and Visualizations

In the Power BI visualization phase, three key measures were created:

1.Total Customers: Calculated from the customer ID.

2.Lost Customers: Derived from the churn column.

3.Churn Rate: Calculated as the percentage of lost customers to total customers.

The following visualizations were used to represent the data:

1.Cards: Displaying total customers, lost customers, and churn rate.

2.Pie Chart: Showing customers by gender.

3.Stacked Column Chart: Illustrating the top 3 products by customer count.

4.Donut Charts:
  
  i.Customers by country.

  ii.Customers by churn status.

  iii.Credit card holders by customer status.
  
  iv.Active vs. inactive customers.

5.Clustered Bar Chart: Showing the number of customers by country and gender.

6.Line and Clustered Column Charts:

7.Number of customers by churn rate and age group bins.

8.Number of customers by credit score and churn rate.

9.Stacked Column Chart: Highlighting credit card holders by age and gender.

This comprehensive analysis provides a detailed understanding of the factors affecting customer churn, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions to improve customer retention and satisfaction.
